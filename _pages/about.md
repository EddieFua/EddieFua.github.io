# Welcome! 
I am Yinghao FU, currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU), where I am mentored by Professor [Yi Yang](https://yiyangphd.github.io/). Prior to this, I obtained my Master's degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), where I am advised by Professor [Tianwei Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianwei/) and [Shuang Li](https://shuangli01.github.io/).

My research focuses on developing data-driven and theory-driven methods to address challenges in genomics data analysis, with applications in healthcare.

You can find my CV here: [Yinghao Fu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:yinghao.fu@my.cityu.edu.hk).
